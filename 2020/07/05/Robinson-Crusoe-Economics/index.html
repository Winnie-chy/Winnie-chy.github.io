        <p>I still keep reading the economic book named Lessons for the Young Economist since I haven’t finished it yet and I would like to share a chapter that I thought it was quite interesting. The whole chapter is based on another famous book called Robinson Crusoe.</p>
<p>I believe most people have read or heard about Robinson Crusoe when they are young. The book tells a story of Crusoe, a young sailor who experienced shipwrecked and had to live on a lonely island for 28 years before he was saved. He worked hard, building houses, harvesting grain, taming goats and making clothes out of animal skins. He also wrestled with wild animals. Everyone is impressed by the smart and strong Crusoe in the book.</p>
<p>The whole chapter introduces Robinson Crusoe Economics which uses the name of this brave sailor and uses his examples to introduce many economic concepts. Just think about the problem by using his thoughts. First of all, if you see Robinson was trapped on an island, he must look around the whole island in order to determine what resources are available for him to making plans. All the resources like food and water are scarce so he must use them economically. He must think about the results carefully before using them. However, resources like air and gravity aren’t scarce resources so he doesn’t need to care about them.</p>
<p>Moving on, there are more separation for goods. The scarce goods that directly help get to the purpose are consumer goods while those not directly help are product goods. They can change by the purpose of users. Then, we can divide product goods into land and natural resources. Capital goods are also man-made resources a part of product goods. In this way, Crusoe divided the scarce goods of his world into natural resources, labour, capital goods and consumer goods. They influence and connect with each other, income and savings appear. When a factor of production is used to produce future income, that is investment. If he uses these resources properly, his productivity will increase as well. Moreover, goods are valued by unit, so if Crusoe’s house catch a fire, which was more important to him, a watch or a coconut? Most people would say the coconut is more important, but if he has 100 coconuts stored outside, it makes sense for him to choose the watch. In addition, all these gains and losses are helping Crusoe make choices. This is called opportunity cost. Last but not the least, all his actions are guided by expectation so clearly, no all his choices are correct.</p>
<p>I’ve never read a book that tells so many complicated, confusing definitions simply by a character in a book. In this way, the economy really becomes fun and easy to understand.</p>
