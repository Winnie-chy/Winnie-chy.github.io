        <p>Last year, 2020, was a very important year in human history. In this year, people all over the world have experienced a lot and everyday good or bad news was spread everywhere. While every country is busy and chaotic, South Korea reported that its registered population for the whole of 2020 will be 51.83 million, down 21,000 from the previous year on January 3rd.</p>
<p>As we learned in Economic class, there are many standards to estimate the development of a country such as the death rate and the birth rate are important indexes and references. It was the first time in South Korean history that there have been more deaths than births. South Korea’s fertility rate (the number of children per woman of childbearing age) decreased rapidly from around 1.2 in 2016 to 0.92 in 2019, with less than one child per woman. The same thing happened in Taiwan that the number of births in Taiwan dropped to 165,200 in 2020, with 173,100 deaths. This is also the first time in Taiwan’s history that the population has experienced negative growth. In Asia, however, Japan’s population crisis has already occurred, and population aging is also the worst. Japan’s population reached an all-time high of 128 million in 2009. But since then, Japan has experienced 11 years of negative population growth, with the total population falling to 125 million by July 2020. In 2019, the proportion of population over 65 in Japan has reached 28.4%, ranking first in the world. The worst thing is that if South Korea is where Japan was ten years ago, China’s demographic situation will soon be like South Korea’s. There is no denying that a demographic crisis is spreading across East Asia.</p>
<p> <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/sOKzAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/25/sOKzAP.png" alt="sOKzAP.png"></a></p>
<p>There are two reasons that I came up with to explain this phenomenon. One is that women are becoming more educated, and the rate of women who choose to delay or even not marrying increase. The average age of first marriage for South Korean women has risen from 24.8 in 1990 to 30.4 today. The age at which women had their first child was also delayed to 31.6. As the level of education increases, women begin to take the initiative to ask for the right to work, to be paid more, to be in charge of themselves, and not to be regarded as a housewife who can only “take care of the husband and raise the children”. As a result, they chose not to marry or have children to pursue their own careers and freedom, directly challenging the traditional patriarchal society. Second, the cost of raising children is too high, resulting in too much economic pressure to have children. Highly developed urban economy with high price level and unreachable housing prices make family with middle income suffer from debts. In Japan, the cost of a child’s 15 years from kindergarten to high school is about 5.23 million yen. However, the average annual income of Japanese people is only about 4 million yuan. Also, in South Korea, the cost of raising a child is about 14 million won a year on average. The average South Korean worker earns 41 million won a year and spends a third of his income on raising children. Moreover, there is an opportunity cost to having children for women. During their pregnancy leave, their jobs are possibly be replaced by others, resulting in missing the chances for promotion and salary increase. Many companies are also reluctant to recruit women who are possible to have children because it’s a waste of company’s efficiency and performance if women have pregnancy leave with their paid in the future.</p>
<p>The possible solution is that government should raise their spending in order to increase the fertility rate. First of all, in order to eliminate the public’s stereotype of women and increase women’s rights, the government can advertise more to increase their awareness and call for equality. Also, government can offer subsidies to support middle class families who have more than one child such as provide more money welfare and baby products to improve their living standard. What’s more, to make women receive more equal treatment, the government can require companies to give women enough holidays and reserved positions to encourage them to have children without worrying about their careers.</p>
<p>It seems that the key point is that the birth rate of a country is decreasing, but in fact it reflects the proof of New Age Women for their economic independence and working ability and challenge to the inequality between men and women in the past. Hopefully, with the intervention of the government and the change in the minds of the people in the new era, every country will get an appropriate fertility rate.</p>

        <p>This National Day holiday, my mother and I went to the Poly Theatre to enjoy the play midsummer night’s dream. To be honest, I didn’t know anything about drama before. It was also my first time to see a drama, so I lacked the knowledge about drama.</p>
<p>All stage plays are divided into several categories, as shown in the picture below. Among them, I focus on the drama. Drama mainly based on dialogue. It is a comprehensive art with script creation, director, performance, stage design, lighting and commentary indispensable. It came to China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Different from traditional stage plays and operas, the main way to performance of drama is the unaccompanied dialogues or monologues of the actors on the stage, accompanied by a small amount of music and singing. The introduction of European drama into China led to the rise of Modern Chinese drama. They reflect social life through characters, so dialogues are personalized, natural, refined, vivid, beautiful, expressive, easy to understand and can be accepted by the public.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/11/0gmqpD.jpg" alt="0gmqpD.jpg"></p>
<p>After searching the Internet, these are quite different from the drama I originally thought. Since Cats and Phantom of the Opera are so famous, I have seen some clips in my music class at school and thought that all dramas are stories composed of a lot of music and dance like them. So, I think the midsummer night’s dream is also the kind of romantic comedy story performed by dancing in a very beautiful background. It wasn’t until I realized that I was watching an adapted play that I thought it was very “Chinese style”. The adapted one not only changes the names of the characters, but also changes lots of the plots. Exaggerations are used to increase the numbers of punchlines, which makes people burn into a laugher and feel like watching a comedy sketch you see at the Spring Festival gala.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also quite admire the skills of these actors. I think it is very hard to rehearse a perfect drama. Acting drama totally different from shooting TV series or movies that if actors are not satisfied, the whole movie clips can be shot again. Drama is instantaneous and performed in front of all the audience. Therefore, every detail of the performance such as every line and actor’s expression and emotions should be the most perfect. Therefore, actors need to have a strong ability to improvise. Even if they encounter some unexpected situations during the performance, they should try their best to solve them without letting the audience see the flaws and then continue to complete the performance.</p>
<p>Due to the adaptation of the play place too much, to be honest I am a little bit disappointed to this drama. To my view, I prefer to see the original a midsummer night’s dream, or in the other words, through the information of the stage, I prefer to see the opera than the drama because they have beautiful dancing and singing, bring a person the edification and enjoy the beauty of art.</p>

        <p>Chinese people are famous for their hospitality all over the world. It has almost become a Chinese tradition that the host will take friends and relatives to a nearby restaurant for big meals when guests come to visit the host.</p>
<p>In order to satisfy the guests as well as Chinese people don’t want others to think they are poor, they usually order more than enough food and this both a waste of money and food. Food waste has become a serious problem especially during the peak period of holidays. The government had to encourage the rule “N-1” which means every time order one less dishes than the number of people. However, according to the research of some economists, there are simpler ways than the “N-1” rule.</p>
<p>The first method is about the psychological “ Dolboef illusion”, in which background affects a lot when people make judgements about the shape of an object. As shown in the picture below, the area of black circle in the middle on the right looks larger than that on the left but in fact, the black circle is the same. Economists associate this phenomenon with food waste so in the same way, people will feel that the same amount of food is larger on a small plate than on a large one and will not order as much food without realizing. In 2012, two economists called Kallbekken and Salen worked with hotels on a study of food waste and plate size. In 2013 Pelle Guldborg Hansen, another economist, also became interested in the link between plate size and food savings and concluded that a 3cm reduction in plate diameter resulted in a 26% reduction in food waste. Therefore, reducing the diameter of the plate can really effectively reduce food waste.</p>
<p><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/08/26/dWwLIU.jpg" alt="dWwLIU.jpg"></p>
<p>Another useful way also uses psychology to guide people’s decisions through small changes which called nudge theory from behavioral economist Richard Taylor (2017 Nobel Prize in Economics). He mentioned four rules which are easy, attractive, social, timely and collectively called “EAST”. For two of them, easy and social, have simple examples. Firstly, it’s all known that push a heavy object against the table forced and because of friction, the object will soon stop moving. Human motivation also reduced when face a lot of troubles. As a result, reducing the size of plate also helps save food because people have to run more times to get the same amount of food. Then for social, humans are social animals, and the stress of not fitting in can lead people to change their behavior. For instance, SAN Marcos, California has introduced a new electricity bill to encourage local households to use less electricity. People will be able to see not only their own bills in recent weeks, but also the average use of electricity by their neighbors. When people find that they use far more electricity than their neighbors, they gradually reduce their use of electricity. The same goes for saving food.</p>
<p>A rational person will never order too much and waste food. But real people are not entirely rational. As a result, some helps from economists will hopefully make us live better.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>In economics, there is a word everyone is familiar with called opportunity cost which means the best alternative forgone. Also, when I knew the concept of game theory in an economic book, I realized that in some ways, game theory was very similar to opportunity cost.</p>
<p>When producers make an economic decision, it certainly contain gains and losses. That’s why they have to make the optimal decision after careful consideration and estimation of advantages and disadvantages. Unlike opportunity cost, game theory is not about making a decision, but about two people using and changing their strategies in order to win in an equal game. Game theory considers the predictive behavior and actual behavior of individuals in the game and studies their optimization strategies.</p>
<p>In game theory, the most famous and easy-understood example is the ‘Prisoner’s Dilemma’ model given by Tucker. The model tells us the story of a policeman and a thief in a special way. Suppose two thieves conspire to commit a crime and are caught by the police.</p>
<p>The police put the two men in separate rooms for questioning. The policy was: If both suspects confessed and the evidence was conclusive, both were convicted, and each had to spend eight years in prison. If only one of the suspects confesses and the other denies the confession, the person who denied will be given an additional two years in prison, and the offender’s sentence will be reduced by eight years and will be released immediately. If both men deny it, the police can’t convict them on other charges for lack of evidence but can send each man to prison for one year. The following table shows the payment matrix for this game.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>A\B</th>
<th>confess</th>
<th>deny</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>confess</td>
<td>8\8</td>
<td>0\10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>deny</td>
<td>10\0</td>
<td>1\1</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>From the table, since neither person knows what the other will choose, confession is always optimal because it makes sure you’re not at a disadvantage between two people. But if they all choose to “deny”, they will each be sentenced to only one year in prison. As a result, (denial, denial) is Pareto optimal, because any other action choice combination that deviates from this action choice combination will make a person in a worse situation. However, “confession” is the dominant strategy of any criminal suspect, and (confession, confession) is a dominant strategic equilibrium, Nash equilibrium. It is not hard to see that there is a conflict between Nash equilibrium and Pareto here.</p>
<p>Of course, this example is just for a better understanding of game theory, and it doesn’t work in psychologically or socially ways. I don’t understand this complicated concept at first, but after seeing this example, I think game theory is two people making decisions without letting each other know. And that’s why there is more uncertainty than the opportunity cost.</p>

        <p>I never thought that one day I would have contact with the intangible cultural heritage of Jiangsu Province before. Since my childhood, I only knew that one of my relatives was a great craftsman, and I didn’t know that he was the inheritor of velvet flower until later this craft was gradually becoming world-famous.</p>
<p>Velvet flowers mean glory in ancient China which has a quite positive wishes and is one of the representatives of the wealth in Chinese culture. They are made by silk manually after more than ten processes so that a piece of work usually takes more than two weeks. </p>
<p>I was just amazed by the deliciated works of animals or flowers I have seen before at their lifelike but never thought about the process of making these works. It wasn’t until I had the opportunity to learn each step of the process myself that I realized how difficult the technique was. Just for the first two steps, firstly was to straighten out the silk. I was quite confident that I can deal with it since I saw other people can do this quickly and nicely just by combing using fingers. But until I did it myself, no matter what I did, even with a brush, I could not make the silk smooth and neat enough. These knotted silks would surely affect the next few steps. Then I had to fold the thin copper wire in half and twist the top together so that the copper wire clamped the silk in the middle. Although the instructions were simple and clear, it took me a lot of effort just to rub up the two ends of the copper wire because I sometimes rubbed out the copper oxide and led to the loss of friction which made the copper wire become useless.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the non-genetic inheritor is faced with the survival problem. On the other hand, due to the great pressure of social employment and survival, even if some college students are interested in making velvet, they will eventually give up this ideal for some reason which lead to the lack of successors for this unique technique. Now the inheritances try their best to combine the flower with the trend. Through TV dramas and advertisements, they hope that people all over the world can realize the beauty of the flower and prevent the loss of this precious skill. He also set up a company and recruited staff to increase the output and efficiency of his works in order to customize products and offer better services.</p>
<p>There are many other rare and little-known skills in Chinese culture besides the velvet flowers such as making clay figurines and weaving Chinese knots. I hope that these ancient skills will be valued by the young generation instead of being forgotten with the development of the times.</p>

        <p>This week, our family went to Yangzhou in order to take my first IELTs test. Because of the spread of covid-19, many exam centers have been cancelled, so I have to take the exam in Yangzhou. </p>
<p>The first is the trip to Yangzhou. It was a really hard trip for all of us since we not only had to pay extra fee for the hotel and gas, but also went there twice which took for four hours each time. However, I have to admit that Yangzhou does have some impressive local snacks, and I took the opportunity to taste a lot of delicious food. What I liked the most is the baozi there because every kind of baozi there with different flavors is full of praise. As a result, we brought many baozi back to Nanjing. Moreover, the night before my speaking test, my parents and I decided to go shopping in Dongguan Street together after dinner. It was a place similar to Confucius Temple and Lao Mendong in Nanjing, where modern shops combined with ancient architectural styles to create a lively scene and a wide variety of goods for consumers to choose from.</p>
<p>As for IELTs, I was also full of nervousness and curiosity, because I have never experienced such an international formal exam before, and I feel extremely upset when I meet foreigners face to face. Before the test, I prepared all the test supplies in advance, such as the admission ticket and a bottle of water without cover. When I actually entered the examination room, I found that the rules were stricter than any exam I had ever taken. We were not only not allowed to wear anything like metal necklaces, earrings, but also our body had to be scanned. I wondered why I had to enter the exam room 30 minutes early at the beginning, but when I arrived, I realized that almost all the time had been spent verifying identities. We were all carefully compared with our ID cards, photographed and even our fingerprints were recorded. It’s the first time I experienced such a strict check. Luckily, I found that the examiners are kind enough that made me feel less stressed. Everything here is well-organized, the staff is also very responsible and instructions are very clear. Those really provide a lot of convenience for the first test candidates like me.</p>
<p>In addition, I hope I can pass the IELTS exam as soon as possible since I don’t want to carry this burden to the second year which already full of academic achievements.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I haven’t experienced what I consider to be a significant failure, but there are things I regret.</p>
<p>It was the high school entrance exam, and we were going to have an English human-computer speaking test. However, I didn’t take the test seriously at all, since it sounded like most people could get full marks. </p>
<p>Before the exam, we had a booklet that covered all the topics that could be selected and all we needed to do was to recite the articles fluently. I looked through the booklet and found that the articles were very simple and short, so I thought it was quite an easy test and there was no need to take time to practice them. When my classmates all rushed to the teacher to recite the passage and even when someone started to recite the passage for a second time, I still refused to go to the teacher’s office. Finally, the teacher forced me to go to her office. I recited every day like everyone else, but I never took it to heart and forgot the articles just after I recited them to the teacher. In this way, on the day of the exam, however, I began to panic when I saw that others were confident. Because the passages were not memorized, I could only guess in the exam. </p>
<p>After the test results came out, in the test where most people got full marks, I actually had one point deducted. Even some people who normally didn’t do as well as me got better marks than I did. I was shocked and couldn’t believe this result and regretted that I had underestimated the exam at the beginning. We only sit the high school entrance examination once in our life and in such an important exam, every point counts. It has passed and I cannot retake it. I did not get full marks because of overconfidence and an inability to improvise. </p>
<p>From this experience, I learned the lesson that for study, no matter how small tests are, we shouldn’t be lazy and ignore them. Careful preparation is the only way to get the high marks that you expect. This applies to life in general and not just to studying. It is worth taking even small things seriously. One should never dismiss small things as you don’t know how much impact they might have.</p>

        <p>I still keep reading the economic book named Lessons for the Young Economist since I haven’t finished it yet and I would like to share a chapter that I thought it was quite interesting. The whole chapter is based on another famous book called Robinson Crusoe.</p>
<p>I believe most people have read or heard about Robinson Crusoe when they are young. The book tells a story of Crusoe, a young sailor who experienced shipwrecked and had to live on a lonely island for 28 years before he was saved. He worked hard, building houses, harvesting grain, taming goats and making clothes out of animal skins. He also wrestled with wild animals. Everyone is impressed by the smart and strong Crusoe in the book.</p>
<p>The whole chapter introduces Robinson Crusoe Economics which uses the name of this brave sailor and uses his examples to introduce many economic concepts. Just think about the problem by using his thoughts. First of all, if you see Robinson was trapped on an island, he must look around the whole island in order to determine what resources are available for him to making plans. All the resources like food and water are scarce so he must use them economically. He must think about the results carefully before using them. However, resources like air and gravity aren’t scarce resources so he doesn’t need to care about them.</p>
<p>Moving on, there are more separation for goods. The scarce goods that directly help get to the purpose are consumer goods while those not directly help are product goods. They can change by the purpose of users. Then, we can divide product goods into land and natural resources. Capital goods are also man-made resources a part of product goods. In this way, Crusoe divided the scarce goods of his world into natural resources, labour, capital goods and consumer goods. They influence and connect with each other, income and savings appear. When a factor of production is used to produce future income, that is investment. If he uses these resources properly, his productivity will increase as well. Moreover, goods are valued by unit, so if Crusoe’s house catch a fire, which was more important to him, a watch or a coconut? Most people would say the coconut is more important, but if he has 100 coconuts stored outside, it makes sense for him to choose the watch. In addition, all these gains and losses are helping Crusoe make choices. This is called opportunity cost. Last but not the least, all his actions are guided by expectation so clearly, no all his choices are correct.</p>
<p>I’ve never read a book that tells so many complicated, confusing definitions simply by a character in a book. In this way, the economy really becomes fun and easy to understand.</p>

        <p>I’ve always believed achievements are gained by working hard. The process is painful, but it always ends well. For me, my greatest accomplishment was my progress in politics and history subjects in the senior high school entrance examination. Because the high school entrance exam only allows about 50 percent of middle-school students to go to high school, and it needs higher scores if they want to go to better ones, every point counts.</p>
<p>These are two important courses each of which has a score of 60. The score is not high, but the content should be memorized even more than other subjects. Because I neglected these two seemingly unimportant subjects in the first two years, it was particularly painful for me to study these two subjects in the last year. I had to start all over again, relearning three years of work in one year and studying other subjects at the same time. To be honest, I was very confused about what to do and where to start at first, all the books seemed too complicated to me. I could hardly understand the teacher because I didn’t have any previous knowledge. I struggled at first, but when I saw that I couldn’t do my homework and my test scores were so bad that I was way behind the others, I even wanted to give up. </p>
<p>I failed to improve in either of my two courses and felt hopeless after a period of time. I was very worried, and so were my parents. However, they didn’t know what I was learning so they couldn’t help me. After seeing what a terrible job I had made of multiple choice questions, my father decided to help me. He began to read my book and learned by himself. From then on, every day on his return from work, he picked up my politics and history books and instead of enjoying watching films on the sofa, he tried his best to understand that complicated information. I knew that it was even harder for him to learn this after a busy day at work. To my surprise, he finished all the books quickly and every evening he explained the contents of the book to me. It was really difficult for us because we sometimes talked until late at night and felt quite sleepy the next day.</p>
<p>Moreover, when I had a problem that I couldn’t ‘ solve , I would discuss it with my father to find the answer. Maybe what he said was not exactly right, but it truly made me understand the two subjects and I made some progress. I gradually mastered the techniques for solving problems. We were all very excited about the progress I made, and I became more confident. My excitement couldn’t be described in words and I felt a great sense of achievement after  getting  the final results. Although my score was not very high, it did not affect the total score much. </p>
<p>My father and I made this progress together, so I was grateful for his help. Perhaps for others, getting higher marks in politics and history is a very simple thing, but for me, the fact that I didn’t give up in my last year and the scores rose from 40 to 50 is the thing that I am most proud of. In conclusion, I think this can be called my greatest academic achievement.</p>

        <p>I had never thought of a book seminar before. Without such regular seminars, I don’t even read much. But now, since each of us has to write and share reading notes by online discussion every week, it successful prompted me to start reading.</p>
<p>The teacher advised us to choose books related to the major we wanted to choose, so I chose a book called “ Lessons for the Young Economist” by Robert P. Murphy. To be honest, I have no interest in these professional books at all. The name of this book suggested that it was a serious and boring book on various economic theories which are hard to understand, and I hesitated to read it at first.</p>
<p>However, when I actually opened the book, it wasn’t quite what I thought it was. It’s not like other books that make you want to give up the moment you open it. This book starts with the simplest and most basic things. The first chapter introduces “what and why” – what is economics and why we should study economics. The author told us to look at the world in unique ways like an economist. Then, it defined economics is the study of exchange instead of the study of money. Scarcity is the key word to “economic problems”. As for why to study economics, it is very interesting and useful. It can help individuals make decisions in their career and help them get closer to their goals.</p>
<p>In the second chapter, the book introduces us to “how”, that is, how to discover the principles of economics. A geometric pattern is more suitable. Start with some reasonable definitions and premises, build the theorem from the original definition plus logical deduction, and then use the new conclusion from each step to derive further theorems. In order to explain this abstract wethod, the book uses a lot of vivid and interesting examples.</p>
<p>What impressed me most was one example that the author mentioned in the book– people enjoy sitting in the first or last row of a roller coaster the most. There was no explanation in the book, but my teacher was curious about the reason. Under her inspiration and help, I combined the content below and online information in order to solve this problem. Finally, we conclude that the most exciting position of the roller coaster is the last row because when the last row reaches the top, the roller coaster begins to accelerate. Therefore, it is the last row that really experience acceleration from the top to the bottom. But the first row is more visually striking. This means, for an economist, people who have already exchanged time and energy to wait in line for a long time surely expect the best experience in return.</p>
<p>The reading seminar is really a great opportunity for us not only learn a lot from others, but also solve our own problems. Especially for students like me who don’t like reading, it can make me develop the habit of reading.</p>
