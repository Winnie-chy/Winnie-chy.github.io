        <p>I never thought that one day I would have contact with the intangible cultural heritage of Jiangsu Province before. Since my childhood, I only knew that one of my relatives was a great craftsman, and I didn’t know that he was the inheritor of velvet flower until later this craft was gradually becoming world-famous.</p>
<p>Velvet flowers mean glory in ancient China which has a quite positive wishes and is one of the representatives of the wealth in Chinese culture. They are made by silk manually after more than ten processes so that a piece of work usually takes more than two weeks. </p>
<p>I was just amazed by the deliciated works of animals or flowers I have seen before at their lifelike but never thought about the process of making these works. It wasn’t until I had the opportunity to learn each step of the process myself that I realized how difficult the technique was. Just for the first two steps, firstly was to straighten out the silk. I was quite confident that I can deal with it since I saw other people can do this quickly and nicely just by combing using fingers. But until I did it myself, no matter what I did, even with a brush, I could not make the silk smooth and neat enough. These knotted silks would surely affect the next few steps. Then I had to fold the thin copper wire in half and twist the top together so that the copper wire clamped the silk in the middle. Although the instructions were simple and clear, it took me a lot of effort just to rub up the two ends of the copper wire because I sometimes rubbed out the copper oxide and led to the loss of friction which made the copper wire become useless.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the non-genetic inheritor is faced with the survival problem. On the other hand, due to the great pressure of social employment and survival, even if some college students are interested in making velvet, they will eventually give up this ideal for some reason which lead to the lack of successors for this unique technique. Now the inheritances try their best to combine the flower with the trend. Through TV dramas and advertisements, they hope that people all over the world can realize the beauty of the flower and prevent the loss of this precious skill. He also set up a company and recruited staff to increase the output and efficiency of his works in order to customize products and offer better services.</p>
<p>There are many other rare and little-known skills in Chinese culture besides the velvet flowers such as making clay figurines and weaving Chinese knots. I hope that these ancient skills will be valued by the young generation instead of being forgotten with the development of the times.</p>

        <p>This week, our family went to Yangzhou in order to take my first IELTs test. Because of the spread of covid-19, many exam centers have been cancelled, so I have to take the exam in Yangzhou. </p>
<p>The first is the trip to Yangzhou. It was a really hard trip for all of us since we not only had to pay extra fee for the hotel and gas, but also went there twice which took for four hours each time. However, I have to admit that Yangzhou does have some impressive local snacks, and I took the opportunity to taste a lot of delicious food. What I liked the most is the baozi there because every kind of baozi there with different flavors is full of praise. As a result, we brought many baozi back to Nanjing. Moreover, the night before my speaking test, my parents and I decided to go shopping in Dongguan Street together after dinner. It was a place similar to Confucius Temple and Lao Mendong in Nanjing, where modern shops combined with ancient architectural styles to create a lively scene and a wide variety of goods for consumers to choose from.</p>
<p>As for IELTs, I was also full of nervousness and curiosity, because I have never experienced such an international formal exam before, and I feel extremely upset when I meet foreigners face to face. Before the test, I prepared all the test supplies in advance, such as the admission ticket and a bottle of water without cover. When I actually entered the examination room, I found that the rules were stricter than any exam I had ever taken. We were not only not allowed to wear anything like metal necklaces, earrings, but also our body had to be scanned. I wondered why I had to enter the exam room 30 minutes early at the beginning, but when I arrived, I realized that almost all the time had been spent verifying identities. We were all carefully compared with our ID cards, photographed and even our fingerprints were recorded. It’s the first time I experienced such a strict check. Luckily, I found that the examiners are kind enough that made me feel less stressed. Everything here is well-organized, the staff is also very responsible and instructions are very clear. Those really provide a lot of convenience for the first test candidates like me.</p>
<p>In addition, I hope I can pass the IELTS exam as soon as possible since I don’t want to carry this burden to the second year which already full of academic achievements.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I haven’t experienced what I consider to be a significant failure, but there are things I regret.</p>
<p>It was the high school entrance exam, and we were going to have an English human-computer speaking test. However, I didn’t take the test seriously at all, since it sounded like most people could get full marks. </p>
<p>Before the exam, we had a booklet that covered all the topics that could be selected and all we needed to do was to recite the articles fluently. I looked through the booklet and found that the articles were very simple and short, so I thought it was quite an easy test and there was no need to take time to practice them. When my classmates all rushed to the teacher to recite the passage and even when someone started to recite the passage for a second time, I still refused to go to the teacher’s office. Finally, the teacher forced me to go to her office. I recited every day like everyone else, but I never took it to heart and forgot the articles just after I recited them to the teacher. In this way, on the day of the exam, however, I began to panic when I saw that others were confident. Because the passages were not memorized, I could only guess in the exam. </p>
<p>After the test results came out, in the test where most people got full marks, I actually had one point deducted. Even some people who normally didn’t do as well as me got better marks than I did. I was shocked and couldn’t believe this result and regretted that I had underestimated the exam at the beginning. We only sit the high school entrance examination once in our life and in such an important exam, every point counts. It has passed and I cannot retake it. I did not get full marks because of overconfidence and an inability to improvise. </p>
<p>From this experience, I learned the lesson that for study, no matter how small tests are, we shouldn’t be lazy and ignore them. Careful preparation is the only way to get the high marks that you expect. This applies to life in general and not just to studying. It is worth taking even small things seriously. One should never dismiss small things as you don’t know how much impact they might have.</p>

        <p>I still keep reading the economic book named Lessons for the Young Economist since I haven’t finished it yet and I would like to share a chapter that I thought it was quite interesting. The whole chapter is based on another famous book called Robinson Crusoe.</p>
<p>I believe most people have read or heard about Robinson Crusoe when they are young. The book tells a story of Crusoe, a young sailor who experienced shipwrecked and had to live on a lonely island for 28 years before he was saved. He worked hard, building houses, harvesting grain, taming goats and making clothes out of animal skins. He also wrestled with wild animals. Everyone is impressed by the smart and strong Crusoe in the book.</p>
<p>The whole chapter introduces Robinson Crusoe Economics which uses the name of this brave sailor and uses his examples to introduce many economic concepts. Just think about the problem by using his thoughts. First of all, if you see Robinson was trapped on an island, he must look around the whole island in order to determine what resources are available for him to making plans. All the resources like food and water are scarce so he must use them economically. He must think about the results carefully before using them. However, resources like air and gravity aren’t scarce resources so he doesn’t need to care about them.</p>
<p>Moving on, there are more separation for goods. The scarce goods that directly help get to the purpose are consumer goods while those not directly help are product goods. They can change by the purpose of users. Then, we can divide product goods into land and natural resources. Capital goods are also man-made resources a part of product goods. In this way, Crusoe divided the scarce goods of his world into natural resources, labour, capital goods and consumer goods. They influence and connect with each other, income and savings appear. When a factor of production is used to produce future income, that is investment. If he uses these resources properly, his productivity will increase as well. Moreover, goods are valued by unit, so if Crusoe’s house catch a fire, which was more important to him, a watch or a coconut? Most people would say the coconut is more important, but if he has 100 coconuts stored outside, it makes sense for him to choose the watch. In addition, all these gains and losses are helping Crusoe make choices. This is called opportunity cost. Last but not the least, all his actions are guided by expectation so clearly, no all his choices are correct.</p>
<p>I’ve never read a book that tells so many complicated, confusing definitions simply by a character in a book. In this way, the economy really becomes fun and easy to understand.</p>

        <p>I’ve always believed achievements are gained by working hard. The process is painful, but it always ends well. For me, my greatest accomplishment was my progress in politics and history subjects in the senior high school entrance examination. Because the high school entrance exam only allows about 50 percent of middle-school students to go to high school, and it needs higher scores if they want to go to better ones, every point counts.</p>
<p>These are two important courses each of which has a score of 60. The score is not high, but the content should be memorized even more than other subjects. Because I neglected these two seemingly unimportant subjects in the first two years, it was particularly painful for me to study these two subjects in the last year. I had to start all over again, relearning three years of work in one year and studying other subjects at the same time. To be honest, I was very confused about what to do and where to start at first, all the books seemed too complicated to me. I could hardly understand the teacher because I didn’t have any previous knowledge. I struggled at first, but when I saw that I couldn’t do my homework and my test scores were so bad that I was way behind the others, I even wanted to give up. </p>
<p>I failed to improve in either of my two courses and felt hopeless after a period of time. I was very worried, and so were my parents. However, they didn’t know what I was learning so they couldn’t help me. After seeing what a terrible job I had made of multiple choice questions, my father decided to help me. He began to read my book and learned by himself. From then on, every day on his return from work, he picked up my politics and history books and instead of enjoying watching films on the sofa, he tried his best to understand that complicated information. I knew that it was even harder for him to learn this after a busy day at work. To my surprise, he finished all the books quickly and every evening he explained the contents of the book to me. It was really difficult for us because we sometimes talked until late at night and felt quite sleepy the next day.</p>
<p>Moreover, when I had a problem that I couldn’t ‘ solve , I would discuss it with my father to find the answer. Maybe what he said was not exactly right, but it truly made me understand the two subjects and I made some progress. I gradually mastered the techniques for solving problems. We were all very excited about the progress I made, and I became more confident. My excitement couldn’t be described in words and I felt a great sense of achievement after  getting  the final results. Although my score was not very high, it did not affect the total score much. </p>
<p>My father and I made this progress together, so I was grateful for his help. Perhaps for others, getting higher marks in politics and history is a very simple thing, but for me, the fact that I didn’t give up in my last year and the scores rose from 40 to 50 is the thing that I am most proud of. In conclusion, I think this can be called my greatest academic achievement.</p>

        <p>I had never thought of a book seminar before. Without such regular seminars, I don’t even read much. But now, since each of us has to write and share reading notes by online discussion every week, it successful prompted me to start reading.</p>
<p>The teacher advised us to choose books related to the major we wanted to choose, so I chose a book called “ Lessons for the Young Economist” by Robert P. Murphy. To be honest, I have no interest in these professional books at all. The name of this book suggested that it was a serious and boring book on various economic theories which are hard to understand, and I hesitated to read it at first.</p>
<p>However, when I actually opened the book, it wasn’t quite what I thought it was. It’s not like other books that make you want to give up the moment you open it. This book starts with the simplest and most basic things. The first chapter introduces “what and why” – what is economics and why we should study economics. The author told us to look at the world in unique ways like an economist. Then, it defined economics is the study of exchange instead of the study of money. Scarcity is the key word to “economic problems”. As for why to study economics, it is very interesting and useful. It can help individuals make decisions in their career and help them get closer to their goals.</p>
<p>In the second chapter, the book introduces us to “how”, that is, how to discover the principles of economics. A geometric pattern is more suitable. Start with some reasonable definitions and premises, build the theorem from the original definition plus logical deduction, and then use the new conclusion from each step to derive further theorems. In order to explain this abstract wethod, the book uses a lot of vivid and interesting examples.</p>
<p>What impressed me most was one example that the author mentioned in the book– people enjoy sitting in the first or last row of a roller coaster the most. There was no explanation in the book, but my teacher was curious about the reason. Under her inspiration and help, I combined the content below and online information in order to solve this problem. Finally, we conclude that the most exciting position of the roller coaster is the last row because when the last row reaches the top, the roller coaster begins to accelerate. Therefore, it is the last row that really experience acceleration from the top to the bottom. But the first row is more visually striking. This means, for an economist, people who have already exchanged time and energy to wait in line for a long time surely expect the best experience in return.</p>
<p>The reading seminar is really a great opportunity for us not only learn a lot from others, but also solve our own problems. Especially for students like me who don’t like reading, it can make me develop the habit of reading.</p>

        <p>When people mention a famous furniture brands, I believe that most people, even young children, will think of the dark blue square building and the big yellow sign. Obviously, that’s the world’s largest shop-IKEA.</p>
<p>Few people know that meatballs sales helped IKEA make billions from catering, making them the tenth largest food retailer in the world. As a result, I already known IKEA since I was a little girl just because the meatballs and cheesecakes there was amazingly delicious. But the most impressive spirit in IKEA is innovation. They try their best to catch up with the technology and never stop creating. There is a special place for product development and design facilities. It’s interesting that almost all the things they have in office are samples in order to give them more inspiration. They even have a small factory which has advanced machinery inside their office. Moreover, the team also have meeting regularly to discuss new ideas together. I think they have a completely system of innovation so that they can give our surprise every year. This place really has the magic that as soon you’re in you can’t get out. All the things here forced you to give out your money.</p>
<p>Also, many people receive an annual catalog from IKEA. It’s true that IKEA’s biggest marketing tool is still their catalogue. The catalogue takes the whole team a lot of time and efforts to finish. Millions of copies were produced and translated into different languages which is the largest publication in the world. As a result, the most important photo of all is the front cover because it is what people will first see and will influence them a lot. Project manager of catalogue want to show people’s lives more instead of just for commercial use. Of course, there is still a big debate about whether or not to include people on the cover, but most other managers have to care about the company’s benefit at first.</p>
<p>For me, IKEA is not as boring as other stores. The furniture here all have warm colors and beds and sofas are the most comfortable. IKEA’s spirit of innovation and pursuit of perfection make it to become a successful brand.</p>

        <p>I recently took a course to learn English by watching BBC documentaries, and I gradually got to know this colorful world. I found that in all parts of the world, there are so many unspoiled amazing landscapes, which are home to rare animals and plants.</p>
<p>First, I came to rainforest. At any time here, countless species are fighting for space and food. Also, competition force animals to specialize in every aspect of their life.</p>
<p>What impressed me the most is a kind of hummingbird called swordbills. They are the only bird with a beak longer than their body. As a result, they don’t have to join the competition for sweet nectar with other kinds of hummingbirds. I was attracted by their unique appearance, and then I searched the Internet for more information. To my surprised, there are really two sides to everything. Although they don’t have to worry about running out of food, they can never comb their feathers with their beaks. So how they clean their feathers? They can only use their claws to clean up. It seems that animals are doing their best to survive and at the same time, they must give up something.</p>
<p>Not only are animals finding ways to survive, but plants are also “getting smarter”. For example, scientists have found a kind of luminous fungus. You can watch a wonder of the rainforest when night came. The reason is that the light attracts insects. As insects will cover in the fungus’s spores, insects carry these spores to other parts of the forest. It successfully got me interested in plants.</p>
<p>However, there are also moments that make me feel heavy. The monkey called indri is humans’ friends and brothers for a long time. But in recent years, one million hectares of the rainforest have been destroyed in Madagascar alone, and, with it, half the indri families that once lived there before. Local people believed that their song is a call to remind us that we, too, once depended on the jungle.</p>
<p>The Eden is a place of wonder and magic. I was attracted by the colorful birds, the strange-looking plants, the competition and courtship between animals in the mysterious rain forest. I believe that all the natural features and species are a gift to human. We must protect variety of species instead destroying it.</p>

        <p>Recently the news about Luckin successfully caught the public’s eye. When this star company revealed its own financial fraud of 2.2 billion yuan, a run on the bank and a burst of stock was inevitable. A lot of people must have seen the news and feared luckin would bankrupt, so they wanted to use up their coupons before it did. That was the reason why orders flooded in which was crazy and sudden.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is, Luckin has overtaken Starbucks, which has been operating in China for 20 years in total in less than two and a half years.</p>
<p>For ordinary consumers, thoughts about luckin depends more on how long the coupons last. A survey on Weibo asked, “Will you still support luckin?”. Of the total 198,000 people who voted, 100,000 of them said they would drink it if they didn’t go out of business, while another 88,000 said they’d never had love or use up their coupons. Moreover, there have been questions about luckin’s taste, marketing, pricing and management’s true motives. The news occurred on April 3 run act as a signal to the market that a company might be able to spend money at scale but will not cultivate brand loyalty.</p>
<p>In short, luckin has grown to an amazing scale in a very short period of time, gaining a lot of customers almost by letting them enjoy lower prices than other stores and giving away coupons. It is true that the speed of development is shocking, but the disadvantage is that it cannot really attract fixed customers. I believe that once luckin’s price rises, most people will not choose luckin. Why? Because luckin’s quality is not enough to make customers feel it is worth the price, they will forget about luckin and choose other products. This is because luckin has no brand loyalty.</p>
<p>Affected by the outbreak, all industries have suffered great losses, luckin is no exception. Under such circumstances, luckin can only cheat to increase sales in order to gain the trust of investors. But sooner or later this will expose the loophole, completely lost people’s trust.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a lot of companies like Lukin in China, through this incident, I realized that integrity is the most important. For companies, making quality products is more effective than sending coupons. Also, for individuals, remember always be honest to everyone. Otherwise, your lies will be exposed one day.</p>

        <p>March 2020 was a “very magical” month for global capital markets. Global capital markets, typical of the US, are a daily surprise to the people all around the world. As the outbreak grew worse, not only people became more panic, but also an economic crisis may happen.</p>
<p>First, most people have noticed the recent “oil war”. The cause was that there has been a breakdown in talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil production cuts. Instead, both countries wanted to pump more oil. As a result, the global price of crude oil suddenly collapsed, even cheaper than water. On the face of it, the breakdown in oil price may seem like Saudi Arabia and Russia are hurting each other. But in fact, the biggest victim of the oil price war is the US, which has become the world’s largest oil exporter in the 21st century through shale oil extraction technology. Because shale oil is difficult and expensive to extract, if price of each barrel of crude is very low, it will put a large number of small and medium-sized shale oil producers in the US into bankrupt.</p>
<p>The second big consequence of a collapse in oil prices is deflation. Deflation is a much more frightening existence than inflation. Since oil is the raw material for the production of many commodities, the decrease in the price of oil will cause people to have no confidence about the price in the future. As a result, they prefer to reduce consumption and save more money.</p>
<p>As a result, there will be less money circulating in the market, the supply of all kinds of goods will start to exceed demand, then the demand will be depressed and the price will fall, which will lead to people’s income reduction. People have less income will be more refused to spend money, then the economic gradually grows into a vicious cycle. Moreover, a long period of deflation would depress investment and production and lead to higher unemployment and recession.</p>
<p>For me, it is interesting to see the economic knowledge we learned happened in realistic such as deflation and changes in demand and supply. Some knowledge can be difficult to understand in textbooks, but if it appears in real life, it can be experienced and understood more deeply. Economics is a quite interesting subject because it is mysterious and hard to predict accurately. The world is also waiting to see what method different countries will use to overcome economic problems during the covid-19 outbreak.</p>
