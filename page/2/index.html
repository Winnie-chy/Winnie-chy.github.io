        <p>When people mention a famous furniture brands, I believe that most people, even young children, will think of the dark blue square building and the big yellow sign. Obviously, that’s the world’s largest shop-IKEA.</p>
<p>Few people know that meatballs sales helped IKEA make billions from catering, making them the tenth largest food retailer in the world. As a result, I already known IKEA since I was a little girl just because the meatballs and cheesecakes there was amazingly delicious. But the most impressive spirit in IKEA is innovation. They try their best to catch up with the technology and never stop creating. There is a special place for product development and design facilities. It’s interesting that almost all the things they have in office are samples in order to give them more inspiration. They even have a small factory which has advanced machinery inside their office. Moreover, the team also have meeting regularly to discuss new ideas together. I think they have a completely system of innovation so that they can give our surprise every year. This place really has the magic that as soon you’re in you can’t get out. All the things here forced you to give out your money.</p>
<p>Also, many people receive an annual catalog from IKEA. It’s true that IKEA’s biggest marketing tool is still their catalogue. The catalogue takes the whole team a lot of time and efforts to finish. Millions of copies were produced and translated into different languages which is the largest publication in the world. As a result, the most important photo of all is the front cover because it is what people will first see and will influence them a lot. Project manager of catalogue want to show people’s lives more instead of just for commercial use. Of course, there is still a big debate about whether or not to include people on the cover, but most other managers have to care about the company’s benefit at first.</p>
<p>For me, IKEA is not as boring as other stores. The furniture here all have warm colors and beds and sofas are the most comfortable. IKEA’s spirit of innovation and pursuit of perfection make it to become a successful brand.</p>

        <p>I recently took a course to learn English by watching BBC documentaries, and I gradually got to know this colorful world. I found that in all parts of the world, there are so many unspoiled amazing landscapes, which are home to rare animals and plants.</p>
<p>First, I came to rainforest. At any time here, countless species are fighting for space and food. Also, competition force animals to specialize in every aspect of their life.</p>
<p>What impressed me the most is a kind of hummingbird called swordbills. They are the only bird with a beak longer than their body. As a result, they don’t have to join the competition for sweet nectar with other kinds of hummingbirds. I was attracted by their unique appearance, and then I searched the Internet for more information. To my surprised, there are really two sides to everything. Although they don’t have to worry about running out of food, they can never comb their feathers with their beaks. So how they clean their feathers? They can only use their claws to clean up. It seems that animals are doing their best to survive and at the same time, they must give up something.</p>
<p>Not only are animals finding ways to survive, but plants are also “getting smarter”. For example, scientists have found a kind of luminous fungus. You can watch a wonder of the rainforest when night came. The reason is that the light attracts insects. As insects will cover in the fungus’s spores, insects carry these spores to other parts of the forest. It successfully got me interested in plants.</p>
<p>However, there are also moments that make me feel heavy. The monkey called indri is humans’ friends and brothers for a long time. But in recent years, one million hectares of the rainforest have been destroyed in Madagascar alone, and, with it, half the indri families that once lived there before. Local people believed that their song is a call to remind us that we, too, once depended on the jungle.</p>
<p>The Eden is a place of wonder and magic. I was attracted by the colorful birds, the strange-looking plants, the competition and courtship between animals in the mysterious rain forest. I believe that all the natural features and species are a gift to human. We must protect variety of species instead destroying it.</p>

        <p>Recently the news about Luckin successfully caught the public’s eye. When this star company revealed its own financial fraud of 2.2 billion yuan, a run on the bank and a burst of stock was inevitable. A lot of people must have seen the news and feared luckin would bankrupt, so they wanted to use up their coupons before it did. That was the reason why orders flooded in which was crazy and sudden.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is, Luckin has overtaken Starbucks, which has been operating in China for 20 years in total in less than two and a half years.</p>
<p>For ordinary consumers, thoughts about luckin depends more on how long the coupons last. A survey on Weibo asked, “Will you still support luckin?”. Of the total 198,000 people who voted, 100,000 of them said they would drink it if they didn’t go out of business, while another 88,000 said they’d never had love or use up their coupons. Moreover, there have been questions about luckin’s taste, marketing, pricing and management’s true motives. The news occurred on April 3 run act as a signal to the market that a company might be able to spend money at scale but will not cultivate brand loyalty.</p>
<p>In short, luckin has grown to an amazing scale in a very short period of time, gaining a lot of customers almost by letting them enjoy lower prices than other stores and giving away coupons. It is true that the speed of development is shocking, but the disadvantage is that it cannot really attract fixed customers. I believe that once luckin’s price rises, most people will not choose luckin. Why? Because luckin’s quality is not enough to make customers feel it is worth the price, they will forget about luckin and choose other products. This is because luckin has no brand loyalty.</p>
<p>Affected by the outbreak, all industries have suffered great losses, luckin is no exception. Under such circumstances, luckin can only cheat to increase sales in order to gain the trust of investors. But sooner or later this will expose the loophole, completely lost people’s trust.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a lot of companies like Lukin in China, through this incident, I realized that integrity is the most important. For companies, making quality products is more effective than sending coupons. Also, for individuals, remember always be honest to everyone. Otherwise, your lies will be exposed one day.</p>

        <p>March 2020 was a “very magical” month for global capital markets. Global capital markets, typical of the US, are a daily surprise to the people all around the world. As the outbreak grew worse, not only people became more panic, but also an economic crisis may happen.</p>
<p>First, most people have noticed the recent “oil war”. The cause was that there has been a breakdown in talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil production cuts. Instead, both countries wanted to pump more oil. As a result, the global price of crude oil suddenly collapsed, even cheaper than water. On the face of it, the breakdown in oil price may seem like Saudi Arabia and Russia are hurting each other. But in fact, the biggest victim of the oil price war is the US, which has become the world’s largest oil exporter in the 21st century through shale oil extraction technology. Because shale oil is difficult and expensive to extract, if price of each barrel of crude is very low, it will put a large number of small and medium-sized shale oil producers in the US into bankrupt.</p>
<p>The second big consequence of a collapse in oil prices is deflation. Deflation is a much more frightening existence than inflation. Since oil is the raw material for the production of many commodities, the decrease in the price of oil will cause people to have no confidence about the price in the future. As a result, they prefer to reduce consumption and save more money.</p>
<p>As a result, there will be less money circulating in the market, the supply of all kinds of goods will start to exceed demand, then the demand will be depressed and the price will fall, which will lead to people’s income reduction. People have less income will be more refused to spend money, then the economic gradually grows into a vicious cycle. Moreover, a long period of deflation would depress investment and production and lead to higher unemployment and recession.</p>
<p>For me, it is interesting to see the economic knowledge we learned happened in realistic such as deflation and changes in demand and supply. Some knowledge can be difficult to understand in textbooks, but if it appears in real life, it can be experienced and understood more deeply. Economics is a quite interesting subject because it is mysterious and hard to predict accurately. The world is also waiting to see what method different countries will use to overcome economic problems during the covid-19 outbreak.</p>

        <p>Until now, people in different countries have been struggling with this sudden outbreak, which is really a war facing all mankind. From China to the rest of the world, each country has its own unique way of defending itself. Since China was one of the first countries to successfully fight the epidemic, many people said that other countries should learn from China and imitate their methods, which is called “copying homework”. But in fact, many foreigners disagree or even doubt with China’s approach. It’s quite interesting because as Chinese, we don’t understand the ways of other countries, and other countries don’t agree with us as well. This is a strange but also normal phenomenon, just because each country has its own ancient culture, which leads to different ways of thinking. Also, different geographical locations and populations make different countries choose the right way for them to protect against the epidemic.</p>
<p>For example, in Italy, the country with the worst outbreak so far, people criticized the wearing of masks in China as a violation of human rights at first. So, no one took it seriously and wore masks there, which caused the rapid spread of the epidemic, and now people are very scared, and some people gradually agree with China’s method. We may now feel sorry for what has happened to Italy, but it is an inevitable course. Suppose the government asked all people to wear masks in the first place, and people who do not yet know the virus and who are against wearing masks are bound to strongly oppose them and may cause the opposite effect. Even now, there are still quite a lot people who aren’t willing to wear masks.</p>
<p>Not just in Italy, but in other countries as well. The act of “copying homework” will not work at all. Each country has its own way to deal with this problem. This just like two companies, what works for one may not work for the other. Also, for individuals, teachers and parents have told us since we were little to compare with ourselves, not with others, it’s the same thing. Everyone is born with different talent and intelligence which we cannot change.</p>
<p>Anyway, we hope that we will overcome the epidemic as soon as possible.</p>
