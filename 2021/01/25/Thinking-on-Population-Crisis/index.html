        <p>Last year, 2020, was a very important year in human history. In this year, people all over the world have experienced a lot and everyday good or bad news was spread everywhere. While every country is busy and chaotic, South Korea reported that its registered population for the whole of 2020 will be 51.83 million, down 21,000 from the previous year on January 3rd.</p>
<p>As we learned in Economic class, there are many standards to estimate the development of a country such as the death rate and the birth rate are important indexes and references. It was the first time in South Korean history that there have been more deaths than births. South Korea’s fertility rate (the number of children per woman of childbearing age) decreased rapidly from around 1.2 in 2016 to 0.92 in 2019, with less than one child per woman. The same thing happened in Taiwan that the number of births in Taiwan dropped to 165,200 in 2020, with 173,100 deaths. This is also the first time in Taiwan’s history that the population has experienced negative growth. In Asia, however, Japan’s population crisis has already occurred, and population aging is also the worst. Japan’s population reached an all-time high of 128 million in 2009. But since then, Japan has experienced 11 years of negative population growth, with the total population falling to 125 million by July 2020. In 2019, the proportion of population over 65 in Japan has reached 28.4%, ranking first in the world. The worst thing is that if South Korea is where Japan was ten years ago, China’s demographic situation will soon be like South Korea’s. There is no denying that a demographic crisis is spreading across East Asia.</p>
<p> <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/sOKzAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/25/sOKzAP.png" alt="sOKzAP.png"></a></p>
<p>There are two reasons that I came up with to explain this phenomenon. One is that women are becoming more educated, and the rate of women who choose to delay or even not marrying increase. The average age of first marriage for South Korean women has risen from 24.8 in 1990 to 30.4 today. The age at which women had their first child was also delayed to 31.6. As the level of education increases, women begin to take the initiative to ask for the right to work, to be paid more, to be in charge of themselves, and not to be regarded as a housewife who can only “take care of the husband and raise the children”. As a result, they chose not to marry or have children to pursue their own careers and freedom, directly challenging the traditional patriarchal society. Second, the cost of raising children is too high, resulting in too much economic pressure to have children. Highly developed urban economy with high price level and unreachable housing prices make family with middle income suffer from debts. In Japan, the cost of a child’s 15 years from kindergarten to high school is about 5.23 million yen. However, the average annual income of Japanese people is only about 4 million yuan. Also, in South Korea, the cost of raising a child is about 14 million won a year on average. The average South Korean worker earns 41 million won a year and spends a third of his income on raising children. Moreover, there is an opportunity cost to having children for women. During their pregnancy leave, their jobs are possibly be replaced by others, resulting in missing the chances for promotion and salary increase. Many companies are also reluctant to recruit women who are possible to have children because it’s a waste of company’s efficiency and performance if women have pregnancy leave with their paid in the future.</p>
<p>The possible solution is that government should raise their spending in order to increase the fertility rate. First of all, in order to eliminate the public’s stereotype of women and increase women’s rights, the government can advertise more to increase their awareness and call for equality. Also, government can offer subsidies to support middle class families who have more than one child such as provide more money welfare and baby products to improve their living standard. What’s more, to make women receive more equal treatment, the government can require companies to give women enough holidays and reserved positions to encourage them to have children without worrying about their careers.</p>
<p>It seems that the key point is that the birth rate of a country is decreasing, but in fact it reflects the proof of New Age Women for their economic independence and working ability and challenge to the inequality between men and women in the past. Hopefully, with the intervention of the government and the change in the minds of the people in the new era, every country will get an appropriate fertility rate.</p>
