        <p>Week 1<br>The summer vacation before the senior year of high school is crucial, and everyone is seizing the time to enrich their experience. In order to make good use of this precious two months, I decided to go to the company for an internship to experience the life in the workplace. Finally, I succeeded in getting the chance in the sales department of a foreign company.</p>
<p>On the first day, I felt the rush of the company. Early in the morning, the assistant there was nervous about changing the PPT for the morning meeting. She was so busy that she didn’t even have time to greet me. The morning meeting is one of the links that the Marketing Department pays the most attention to, because the salesmen are free most of the time. Only by gathering them together can promote their unity, encourage them to make better performance and pay more attention to work through commendation, welfare and other ways. Every day someone would come on stage to share. What impressed me the most was one of the men shared two cases about his clients and made a summary and reflection on himself: In the company, paying attention to honor and maintain good habits; for clients, stick to long-termism and keep visiting them. After a morning meeting, hundreds of people break up into small groups to talk about their work. They grow by working together to solve problems through transpositional consideration.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I went to a lecture on how to increase the value of your wealth and keeping your assets safe. The speaker was very professional and humorous and I gained a lot. At present, the most important asset people care about is the house. Therefore, he analyzed the surrounding environment of different regions and the company they belongs to to judge whether the house in this place is worth investing. For example, school district houses, he proposed around if there is a lot of house demolition, then do not buy, because of the well-educated group of people is difficult to enter in a short time. Therefore, the student there may have low quality as well. Moreover, if the land is privately owned by a company, that means the government is reluctant to spend money on the surrounding public facilities, so it will be difficult to improve community environment and these kinds of house have no investment value. Although I don’t care much about the house at this age, I still thought that buying a house is also a science, and it is not necessary to hurry to buy when someone is selling.</p>
<p>Through the preliminary understanding and contact in the first week, I have some expectations for the next work and hope that I can grow up in the work.</p>
